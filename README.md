# Gate Surveillance Object Classification using OpenCV and YOLO on Raspberry Pi
## Overview:
### This project utilizes OpenCV and the YOLO (You Only Look Once) object detection architecture to classify and monitor objects passing through a gate using recorded video footage. The implementation is optimized for deployment on a Raspberry Pi, making it suitable for real-time video processing applications such as security monitoring and traffic management

## Installation:
### To run the Python code, make sure Python is installed and import the required libraries:
- numpy
-
